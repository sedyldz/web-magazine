For one thing, the act of speaking has\nreclaimed its meaning. The same goes for looking people in the\neye and the concept of time. Although occasionally for the better,\nthis period has left permanent scars on our floundering civilisation.\nWe can still feel the repercussions of 2020, like a frostbite wound\nthat is yet to heal. I beg you to bear one thing in mind – we may live\nin the present, yet nothing will remain in the present. That was\nnever the case. Misery and hope will prevail, with all their might,\nuntil we reach the inevitable end.","number":"13","cover":{"alternativeText":"Screen Shot 2022-04-24 at 22.27.31.png","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#485878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2996ed632972c4e6f5ba581cfa74b22a/e5a4a/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_22_27_31_efbec38eab.png","srcSet":"/static/2996ed632972c4e6f5ba581cfa74b22a/b7a06/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_22_27_31_efbec38eab.png 258w,\n/static/2996ed632972c4e6f5ba581cfa74b22a/676ac/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_22_27_31_efbec38eab.png 515w,\n/static/2996ed632972c4e6f5ba581cfa74b22a/e5a4a/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_22_27_31_efbec38eab.png 1030w","sizes":"(min-width: 1030px) 1030px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2996ed632972c4e6f5ba581cfa74b22a/d6b6b/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_22_27_31_efbec38eab.webp 258w,\n/static/2996ed632972c4e6f5ba581cfa74b22a/05f30/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_22_27_31_efbec38eab.webp 515w,\n/static/2996ed632972c4e6f5ba581cfa74b22a/328c8/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_22_27_31_efbec38eab.webp 1030w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1030px) 1030px, 100vw"}]},"width":1030,"height":582}}}}},{"id":"01517577-b2d2-58ff-bcbf-626898b260b5","slug":"locality","title":"LOCALITY","description":null,"number":"Issue 02","cover":{"alternativeText":"Screen Shot 2022-04-24 at 12.13.09.png","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/40c11cb0748d85bf8030e8abd361ddec/8616e/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_12_13_09_e1455ac27c.png","srcSet":"/static/40c11cb0748d85bf8030e8abd361ddec/6e586/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_12_13_09_e1455ac27c.png 395w,\n/static/40c11cb0748d85bf8030e8abd361ddec/928ef/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_12_13_09_e1455ac27c.png 789w,\n/static/40c11cb0748d85bf8030e8abd361ddec/8616e/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_12_13_09_e1455ac27c.png 1578w","sizes":"(min-width: 1578px) 1578px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/40c11cb0748d85bf8030e8abd361ddec/1d776/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_12_13_09_e1455ac27c.webp 395w,\n/static/40c11cb0748d85bf8030e8abd361ddec/e3856/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_12_13_09_e1455ac27c.webp 789w,\n/static/40c11cb0748d85bf8030e8abd361ddec/56932/Screen_Shot_2022_04_24_at_12_13_09_e1455ac27c.webp 1578w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1578px) 1578px, 100vw"}]},"width":1578,"height":892}}}}},{"id":"32aec21d-a0aa-5e2c-9e7c-33fe239e542e","slug":"e-1","title":"EARTHLINGS","description":null,"number":"Issue 12","cover":{"alternativeText":"Screen Shot 2022-04-20 at 23.56.52.png","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#586878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a9ce93cdfeeaf010bd52371459b7c134/c440a/Screen_Shot_2022_04_20_at_23_56_52_67bdab81c6.png","srcSet":"/static/a9ce93cdfeeaf010bd52371459b7c134/2f70b/Screen_Shot_2022_04_20_at_23_56_52_67bdab81c6.png 424w,\n/static/a9ce93cdfeeaf010bd52371459b7c134/d758d/Screen_Shot_2022_04_20_at_23_56_52_67bdab81c6.png 847w,\n/static/a9ce93cdfeeaf010bd52371459b7c134/c440a/Screen_Shot_2022_04_20_at_23_56_52_67bdab81c6.png 1694w","sizes":"(min-width: 1694px) 1694px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a9ce93cdfeeaf010bd52371459b7c134/56efa/Screen_Shot_2022_04_20_at_23_56_52_67bdab81c6.webp 424w,\n/static/a9ce93cdfeeaf010bd52371459b7c134/e787f/Screen_Shot_2022_04_20_at_23_56_52_67bdab81c6.webp 847w,\n/static/a9ce93cdfeeaf010bd52371459b7c134/1156e/Screen_Shot_2022_04_20_at_23_56_52_67bdab81c6.webp 1694w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1694px) 1694px, 100vw"}]},"width":1694,"height":957}}}}}]},"strapiGlobal":{"siteName":"212 Magazine","siteDescription":"212 is a biannual magazine based out of Istanbul, published and distributed internationally.
